# Objective:

The main objective of creating such app is to test and explore how devops bridges the gap between development and operations, i.e seemless deployments, automated ci cd pipelines for building and deploying of our code.
NOTE: This repository contains a pretty simple **_Next.js_** note taking app, which with a working Markdown editor, it is not a production ready application but this repository contain various Scripts regarding to devops practices such as 
1. Automated CI CD Pipelines
2. Infrastructure As Code with **_Terraform_**
3. Docker files for local development and also production deployments
4. How to wait for reviews from other peers before mergin any PR in via github actions and deployments
5. Automatic Docker image build and push to Docker Hub via CI CD Pipeline

---

## Why do we need to create this type of project ?

- Devops is a pretty common subject now a days but actually a handful of people don't even know what it is beyond only ci cd pipelines.
- This repository will help them learn **IAC**, Jenkin CI scripts, How to integrate tests with the project, How to setup Precommit hooks with Husky, How to setup Github Actions to achieve automated CI checks
  > **_So keeping all of above mentioned features into a well packed app is the main goal of this project_**
